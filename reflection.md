Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I had intentions of discussing it with Joan, Nadya and Katie, however, due to my last-minute conflicting schedule changes, I was unable to do so. I briefly discussed the assignment with someone who had taken this course last year, discussing the classes used in the code.

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I contacted Professor Jordan through Discord, and intend on following up on the code during their office hours on Thursday 09/28.

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
It was challenging working with Java because each variable type and class had its unique, not-directly-transferrable methods, making it very detailed-oriented. The way that the language is object-oriented makes it easier to be used in collaborative spaces. However, one needs to make sure the methods come together neatly.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages?
Pseudocoding really helps. As long as the bigger image of the code is understood, both the procedural and object-oriented methods could be tackled.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Use the ebook and Oracle. Start small and easy -- chop the code into milestones and build upon the work in each step. I initially had a very hard time with the assignment as I didn't know how to find the relevant classes in Java, and discussing it with a peer was instrumental to my progress -- definitely try working with a classmate.
